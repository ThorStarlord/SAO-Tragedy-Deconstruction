### Scene 1: The Crisis
*   **Event:** Yui's data becomes corrupted, causing her to flicker in and out of existence, her voice distorted.
*   **Asuna's Reaction:** Panicked and emotional, she sees her daughter in distress.
*   **Kirito's Reaction:** Immediately shifts into "beater" mode. He analyzes the data streams, discusses error codes, and focuses on the technical problem. He dismisses Asuna's emotional pleas as unhelpful distractions.
*   **Key Dialogue Snippet:** Asuna: "Kirito, she's in pain!" Kirito: "It's corrupted data, Asuna. We need to find the source of the bug."

### Scene 2: The Quest
*   **Event:** The party discovers the "Yui Restoration Quest," a high-level, non-canon quest designed to restore unique AI data.
*   **Requirement:** The quest requires a specific, rare class: the Incubus Warlock, capable of manipulating "emotional data."
*   **Introduction of the Antagonist:** They find the only available Incubus Warlock, a solo player with a neutral reputation. He's polite, a bit aloof, and agrees to join them for a share of the reward.

### Scene 3: The First Sign of Trouble
*   **Event:** The party must navigate a dangerous, trap-filled dungeon to reach the quest's next stage.
*   **Kirito's Choice:** Kirito chooses a shortcut through a high-risk area, calculating that the time saved outweighs the danger. He announces the plan without discussion.
*   **Friction:** The route is stressful. Asuna nearly falls into a pitfall trap. Kirito saves her but is annoyed, telling her to "keep up."
*   **Antagonist's Action:** The Warlock, seeing Asuna is shaken, offers her a calming potion and a quiet, reassuring word. "He is focused on the goal. Do not mistake his intensity for a lack of care." It's a small, kind gesture. Asuna is grateful.

### Scene 4: The Branching Point
*   **Event:** The party reaches a "Class Sanctum" where the Warlock must choose his advanced class path. The choice is presented as permanent.
*   **The Two Paths:**
    *   **Path 1 (Tank/Support):** "Path of the Protector." Focuses on defense, support, and absorbing damage for allies.
    *   **Path 2 (DPS):** "Path of the Passionate." Focuses on high-risk, high-reward damage that scales with emotional intensity.
*   **Kirito's Decision:** Without consulting anyone, Kirito analyzes the party's composition. They have enough DPS; they lack a dedicated tank. He instructs the Warlock to take the "Protector" path. He explains it in purely mechanical terms: "Your aggro-draw abilities will synergize perfectly with my dual-wielding DPS."
*   **Asuna's Reaction:** She's silent, accustomed to Kirito making these calls.
*   **Antagonist's Reaction:** He simply nods. "As the party leader decides."
*   **End of Act One:** The Warlock's choice is locked in. A subtle, almost unnoticed narrative flag appears: "The Path of Tragedy has been chosen." or "The Path of Satire has been chosen." The players don't see this, but it signals the route lock to the audience.
