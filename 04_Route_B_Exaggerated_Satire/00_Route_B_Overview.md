## Route B: Exaggerated Satire — Overview

**Central Theme:** Absurdity, over-the-top plot devices, and dark comedy. This route parodies and mocks genre tropes, pushing every scenario to its most ridiculous and satirical extreme.

### Structure & Narrative Focus
- The route follows the party as they become entangled in increasingly ludicrous situations, with logic and emotional realism taking a back seat to spectacle and irony.
- Janus (the Incubus Warlock) and Asuna’s affair is openly encouraged by Kirito for the sake of “party synergy,” leading to comically disastrous results.
- The story lampoons the idea of optimization and meta-gaming, with characters making choices that are tactically sound but narratively absurd.
- The climax features a boss fight where the party’s dysfunction is both their greatest strength and their undoing.

### Key Comedic Beats
- Kirito’s relentless focus on numbers and damage output, even as his personal life collapses.
- Janus and Asuna’s “synergy” being treated as a literal game mechanic, with visible buffs and in-game pop-ups.
- Outlandish side quests and NPCs that parody common RPG and anime clichés.
- The final betrayal is played for laughs, with Kirito obliviously celebrating his “victory” as everything else falls apart.

### Character Arcs
| Character | Arc |
|-----------|-----|
| Kirito    | Becomes a caricature of the min-maxing gamer, blind to all but stats and optimization. |
| Asuna     | Torn between embarrassment and amusement at the absurdity, eventually embracing the chaos. |
| Janus     | Revels in his newfound power, playing up the melodrama for comedic effect. |
