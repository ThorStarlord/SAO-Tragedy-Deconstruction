# Scene 1C_01: Inciting Incident

*Summary: The event that sets Asuna and Janus on a path of temptation and emotional conflict. Sensual tension is established, and the first cracks in Asuna's resolve appear.*

After Janus chooses his advancement path, his health begins to deteriorate. At Kirito’s suggestion, Asuna is registered as Janus’s female ally to increase his class power. The moment their bond is formed, subtle changes ripple through both of them: Asuna’s libido gradually intensifies, and she discovers a new section in her status screen—one that tracks her sexual stats. Janus, too, feels his desire for Asuna growing, even as his physical condition worsens.

As Janus’s health declines, the emotional and physical tension between them builds. In his weakest moment, Janus confesses his feelings and, fearing he may not have another chance, asks Asuna to share an intimate moment with him. Overwhelmed by her own longing, Asuna agrees. Their union is both passionate and heartfelt, a culmination of suppressed emotions and new desires.

During their intimacy, Janus’s health is miraculously restored, returning to full strength by the end. Afterwards, the two log into FOG Online and open their status windows, discovering that their abilities—granted by Janus’s advancement path—have grown stronger. Yet, a new anxiety lingers: will Janus’s health begin to deteriorate again, forcing them to repeat this cycle of sacrifice and intimacy?
