### **Class Overview: The Illusion of Power**

The Incubus Warlock is not a class won through brute force, but through emotional subversion. Its mechanics are a direct reflection of its user, Makoto/Janus.

*   **Weak Base Stats:** The class is intentionally designed to be physically weak. It cannot out-damage a dedicated DPS or out-last a true tank. This forces the player (and the character) to rely on insidious, manipulative tactics, mirroring how the antagonist emotionally outmaneuvers Kirito rather than overpowering him.
*   **Debuffs as Psychological Warfare:** The Warlock's core abilities are not simple stat reductions but targeted psychological attacks. Debuffs are named to reflect their narrative purpose, such as:
    *   **Doubt:** Reduces accuracy or critical hit chance.
    *   **Guilt:** A damage-over-time effect that grows stronger the longer an enemy ignores the Warlock.
    *   **Emotional Fatigue:** Saps mana or stamina from targets who are emotionally compromised.
*   **Mind Hex:** The signature ability. It allows the Warlock to manipulate perception.
    *   **Gameplay:** Can remove allies/enemies from a target's vision, force them to target the Warlock, or make them misinterpret environmental cues.
    *   **Narrative Function:** This is dramatic irony as a game mechanic. It allows Janus to literally blind Kirito to red flags or subtly coerce Asuna into actions she believes are her own, making her feel like she is making her own choices.

### **Advancement Paths: Defining the Tragedy**

Kirito's choice of how to "optimize" Janus as a party member directly determines the nature of the story's tragic or satirical unraveling.

#### **Path 1: Pledge of the Confidante (Route A - Nuanced Parody)**

*   **Focus:** Tank / Support
*   **Mechanics:** Janus's defensive abilities and support skills scale directly with the strength and intimacy of his **emotional bonds**. His "Protector's Bond" skill becomes more potent the more an ally confides in him.
*   **Thematic Consequence:** Kirito, seeking a shield for his party, unknowingly commissions Janus to become Asuna's emotional protector. Janus's "tanking" is not just absorbing damage, but absorbing Asuna's guilt, fears, and vulnerabilities. He becomes the only "safe" person for her to turn to, creating an unbreakable psychological dependency that Kirito's logic cannot penetrate.

#### **Path 2: Siren's Embrace (Route B - Exaggerated Satire)**

*   **Focus:** DPS (Damage Per Second)
*   **Mechanics:** Janus's damage output scales with the **intensity and passion of his emotional connections,** particularly illicit or forbidden ones. Skills like "Passionate Strike" and "Burning Jealousy" receive massive bonuses when tied to the affair.
*   **Thematic Consequence:** Kirito, seeking to maximize party damage, is mechanically incentivized to ignore, or even encourage, the affair between Janus and Asuna. The betrayal becomes a quantifiable damage buff. This leads to absurd, darkly comedic scenarios where Kirito might cheer on their "synergy" during a boss fight, completely oblivious to the fact that he is applauding the collapse of his own relationship for a tactical advantage.
