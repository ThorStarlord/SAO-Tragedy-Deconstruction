# Calendar System

## Purpose
Define the mechanics, rules, and narrative implications of the in-game calendar and time system. This ensures consistency and clarity for both development and narrative design.

---

## 1. Core Functionality
- **Display:** The current date and time will be shown in the top-right corner of the screen as a constant overlay during gameplay and major scenes.
- **Progression:** Time advances automatically at scene transitions, after specific player choices, or when explicitly stated in dialogue.
- **Format:** Dates and times are displayed as `YYYY/MM/DD - HH:MM AM/PM` (e.g., 2026/06/11 - 08:00 PM).

## 2. Narrative & Thematic Purpose
- **Dramatic Irony:** The calendar system highlights Kirito's obliviousness by tracking events and changes he is unaware of.
- **Asuna's Erosion:** It marks the slow, gradual process of Asuna's psychological and emotional compromise, making the timeline of her transformation clear.
- **Normalization of Betrayal:** Shows the increasing frequency or routine nature of illicit encounters, emphasizing how betrayal becomes normalized over time.
- **Pacing:** Dictates the story's overall pacing and creates tension by showing time passing, especially before major events or climaxes.

## 3. Key Events & Timestamps
While not every scene's timestamp is listed here, the most critical narrative beats are highlighted:
- **Act One Start:** Yui's corruption (e.g., 2026/06/01 - 07:00 AM)
- **"Storm Night" (Part 1 Setup):** (e.g., 2026/06/10 - 11:00 PM)
- **Asuna "Forgives" Inoda (`Map113`):** (e.g., 2026/06/15 - 09:00 PM; note time elapsed since the storm)
- **Major "Training" Scenes (`Map008`):** (e.g., 2026/06/18 - 04:00 PM; note time elapsed since previous)
- **Memory Corruption Climax:** (e.g., 2026/06/25 - 10:00 PM)
- **"Divine Conception" Ritual Climax:** (e.g., 2026/07/01 - 12:00 AM)

This serves as an internal timeline for writers and designers.

## 4. Integration with Other Mechanics
If certain skills, events, or character states are linked to the passage of time (e.g., "Antagonist's power increases every week"), document those mechanics here for future reference and consistency.

By maintaining this file, you ensure the calendar system is a clear, fundamental aspect of your game's narrative and gameplay design.
