# Route 0 Integration & Narrative Role

The calendar system is a core narrative and gameplay tool in Route 0: The Shared Descent. It is used to:

- **Track the slow progression of relationships and emotional shifts** between Kirito, Asuna, and Janus, reinforcing the central theme that small, well-intentioned acts can accumulate into major consequences over time.
- **Foreshadow key events and character arcs** by marking the passage of days and highlighting moments of emotional neglect, growing bonds, and the build-up to the class advancement choice.
- **Support dramatic irony and player awareness** by making the timeline of misunderstandings and missed connections visible, even as characters remain oblivious.
- **Visually and mechanically reinforce tension** as the story moves from the hopeful beginnings of Act One, through the subtle rifts of Act Two, to the climactic branching point in Act Three. The calendar and time cues (color palette, music, UI) should reflect these emotional beats.
- **Enable player agency and replayability** by making the timing of optional scenes (such as Asuna/Janus conversations) explicit, allowing players to influence subtle stats and future routes.

Writers and designers should use the calendar system to anchor all major and minor events in Route 0, ensuring that the emotional and mechanical stakes are always clear and consistent. For a detailed mapping of foreshadowing and narrative flags, see `05_Foreshadowing_and_Clues.md`.

# Calendar System

## Purpose
Define the mechanics, rules, and narrative implications of the in-game calendar and time system. This ensures consistency and clarity for both development and narrative design.

---

## 1. Core Functionality
- **Display:** The current date and time will be shown in the top-right corner of the screen as a constant overlay during gameplay and major scenes.
- **Progression:** Time advances automatically at scene transitions, after specific player choices, or when explicitly stated in dialogue.
- **Format:** Dates and times are displayed as `YYYY/MM/DD - HH:MM AM/PM` (e.g., 2026/06/11 - 08:00 PM).

---

## 2. Narrative & Thematic Purpose
- **Dramatic Irony:** The calendar system highlights Kirito's obliviousness by tracking events and changes he is unaware of.
- **Asuna's Erosion:** It marks the slow, gradual process of Asuna's psychological and emotional compromise, making the timeline of her transformation clear.
- **Normalization of Betrayal:** Shows the increasing frequency or routine nature of illicit encounters, emphasizing how betrayal becomes normalized over time.
- **Pacing:** Dictates the story's overall pacing and creates tension by showing time passing, especially before major events or climaxes.

## 3. Key Events & Timestamps
While not every scene's timestamp is listed here, the most critical narrative beats are highlighted:
- **Act One Start:** Yui's corruption (e.g., 2026/06/01 - 07:00 AM)
- **"Storm Night" (Part 1 Setup):** (e.g., 2026/06/10 - 11:00 PM)
- **Asuna "Forgives" Inoda (`Map113`):** (e.g., 2026/06/15 - 09:00 PM; note time elapsed since the storm)
- **Major "Training" Scenes (`Map008`):** (e.g., 2026/06/18 - 04:00 PM; note time elapsed since previous)
- **Memory Corruption Climax:** (e.g., 2026/06/25 - 10:00 PM)
- **"Divine Conception" Ritual Climax:** (e.g., 2026/07/01 - 12:00 AM)

This serves as an internal timeline for writers and designers.

## 4. Integration with Other Mechanics
If certain skills, events, or character states are linked to the passage of time (e.g., "Antagonist's power increases every week"), document those mechanics here for future reference and consistency.

By maintaining this file, you ensure the calendar system is a clear, fundamental aspect of your game's narrative and gameplay design.
