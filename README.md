**Project Title:** SAO: A Tragedy of Optimization

**Concept:** A narrative-driven deconstruction of the *Sword Art Online* story and the NTR genre, presented as a parody/satire game. The story explores the tragic downfall of Kirito and Asuna's relationship, not through external villainy, but as a direct consequence of Kirito's core character flaw: his tendency to view the world and his relationships through the lens of game mechanics and optimization.

The game features a branching narrative with six distinct routes determined by player choice:
1.  **Route A: The Nuanced Parody** – A serious, character-driven tragedy exploring the slow, psychological erosion of a relationship.
2.  **Route B: The Exaggerated Satire** – A darkly comedic route that pushes NTR and JRPG tropes to their most absurd extremes.
3.  **Route C: Erotic Fiction** – Sensual, provocative, and indulgent; Asuna is torn between emotional love and physical craving, with a focus on erotic tension and ambiguous morality.
4.  **Route D: Psychological Horror** – Dark, oppressive, and existential; Asuna faces loss of identity and willpower under manipulative forces, evoking terror and helplessness.
5.  **Route E: Psychological Thriller** – Tense, cerebral, and twisted; Asuna actively navigates manipulation and betrayal in a world of con games and ethical mazes.
6.  **Route F: Tragedy** – Somber, emotional, and morally complex; Asuna’s inevitable downfall unfolds through a series of tragic decisions, leading to bittersweet catharsis.
