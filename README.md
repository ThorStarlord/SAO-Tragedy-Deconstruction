**Project Title:** SAO: A Tragedy of Optimization

**Concept:** A narrative-driven deconstruction of the *Sword Art Online* story and the NTR genre, presented as a parody/satire game. The story explores the tragic downfall of Kirito and Asuna's relationship, not through external villainy, but as a direct consequence of Kirito's core character flaw: his tendency to view the world and his relationships through the lens of game mechanics and optimization.

The game features a branching narrative with two distinct routes determined by player choice:
1.  **Route A: The Nuanced Parody:** A serious, character-driven tragedy exploring the slow, psychological erosion of a relationship.
2.  **Route B: The Exaggerated Satire:** A darkly comedic route that pushes NTR and JRPG tropes to their most absurd extremes.
