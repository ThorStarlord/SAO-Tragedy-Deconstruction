**Route A (`Nuanced_Parody`):** Will focus on slow-burn psychological erosion, realistic emotional manipulation, and tragic, quiet moments of betrayal. The tone will be serious and heartbreaking. This route maintains a serious and heartbreaking tone, focusing on the slow, psychological erosion of Kirito and Asuna's relationship. The tragedy is not sudden but unfolds through a series of quiet, painful moments. Key tragic beats include: Kirito's growing emotional detachment as he focuses solely on the technical aspects of saving Yui; the Incubus Warlock's subtle manipulation, where he masterfully exploits the growing rift by offering Asuna the emotional support Kirito will not; and Asuna's gradual, reluctant turn towards the Warlock, not out of malice, but out of desperation and loneliness. The climax will see Asuna making a devastating choice during the final boss battle, a quiet but profound betrayal that "saves" Yui at the cost of their relationship, leaving Kirito with a hollow victory.
