# Scene 3A-01: The Heroic Sacrifice

**Setting:** The throne room of the Incubus Warlock, a gothic, opulent chamber at the pinnacle of the final dungeon.

**Characters:**
*   Kirito
*   Asuna
*   The Incubus Warlock (Final Boss)

**Scene Outline:**

1.  **The Impossible Fight:** The battle against the Incubus Warlock is underway. He is vastly overpowered, with mechanics designed to counter every strategy the players have. Health bars barely move, and attacks are easily deflected. The mood is desperate.

2.  **The Forbidden Skill:** Kirito realizes they cannot win through conventional means. He accesses a hidden, forbidden skill in his menuâ€”a last-resort ability that promises immense power at a great cost. The description is vague but hints at "total data crystallization."

3.  **A Hero's Monologue:** Kirito tells Asuna this is the only way. He delivers a classic, heroic speech, telling her he's glad he met her and that she must be the one to land the final blow and free everyone. He frames his decision as the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good.

4.  **The "Sacrifice":** Kirito activates the skill. His avatar begins to crystallize, light emanating from him. He is locked in a heroic pose as he becomes a statue of digital light. The Incubus Warlock is caught in the skill's area of effect and is paralyzed, his health bar now vulnerable.

5.  **The Final Blow... Interrupted:** Asuna, tears in her eyes, prepares to strike the paralyzed Warlock to end the game. The scene ends as she raises her sword, ready to fulfill Kirito's dying wish.
