# Scene 3A-02: The Surrender

**Setting:** The same throne room, moments after Kirito's "sacrifice."

**Characters:**
*   Asuna
*   The Incubus Warlock (paralyzed but conscious)

**Scene Outline:**

1.  **The Warlock's Offer:** As Asuna is about to strike, the Incubus Warlock, unable to move but able to speak, makes her an offer. He reveals the truth of Kirito's skill: it's not a sacrifice, but a temporary stasis. He tells her that if she shatters the crystallized Kirito, his data will be permanently deleted. However, if she surrenders to him, he will release Kirito, unharmed, once his "ritual" is complete.

2.  **The Moral Compromise:** The Warlock frames it as a choice: her personal freedom versus Kirito's existence. He preys on her attachment, suggesting that a true hero would sacrifice themselves for the one they love. He offers her a contract in her menuâ€”a binding agreement.

3.  **Asuna's Desperation:** Asuna is torn. She looks at the heroic, crystallized form of Kirito, then at the smirking Warlock. The game's UI flashes with the contract, a stark, legalistic document that contrasts with the high-fantasy setting.

4.  **The Surrender:** Asuna, believing she is saving Kirito, accepts the contract. Her sword clatters to the floor. The Warlock is released from his paralysis. A dark energy envelops Asuna as the terms of the contract take effect. She is now bound to him.

5.  **The Game is "Won":** The Warlock, laughing, announces that with Asuna's surrender, the final condition of his victory has been met. A system announcement declares the game has been cleared. The world begins to dissolve into light as the logout sequence is initiated for all players... except for Asuna.
