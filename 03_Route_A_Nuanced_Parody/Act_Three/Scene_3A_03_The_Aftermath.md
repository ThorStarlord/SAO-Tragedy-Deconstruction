# Scene 3A-03: The Oblivious Return

**Setting:** A sterile, white hospital room. The real world.

**Characters:**
*   Kirito (Kazuto Kirigaya)
*   Suguha (his sister/cousin)

**Scene Outline:**

1.  **Waking Up:** Kirito wakes up in a hospital bed, weak and disoriented. The first thing he sees is the relieved face of his sister, Suguha. He has been in a coma for two years.

2.  **The "Hero's" Welcome:** Suguha explains that he is a hero. News reports praise him as the gamer who "beat" SAO and freed everyone. He is celebrated for his sacrifice, which the media has spun into a legendary tale. There is no mention of Asuna's role in the final moments.

3.  **The Missing Piece:** Kirito asks about Asuna. Suguha's expression becomes hesitant. She tells him that Asuna is still in a coma, one of the 300 players who have not woken up. The official story is that their NerveGear malfunctioned at the last second.

4.  **The Seeds of Doubt:** Kirito is confused. He remembers Asuna being there, ready to end it. He has a fragmented memory of her dropping her sword, but it feels like a dream. He is hailed as a hero, but he feels a growing unease. He believes he saved everyone, but the one person he cared about most is still trapped.

5.  **The Tragic Irony:** The scene ends with Kirito looking out the window, a celebrated hero to the world, but utterly oblivious to the fact that his "heroic sacrifice" was a calculated move by the Warlock, and that Asuna gave up her freedom for him. He is free, but she is not. The tragedy is that he doesn't even know he has failed.
