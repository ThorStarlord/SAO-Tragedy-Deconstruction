# Scene 2A-02: A Quiet Dread

**Objective:** Show the psychological fallout from the Volcano Trial and the shifting dynamics within the group.

**Characters:**
*   Kirito
*   Asuna
*   Antagonist

**Scene Outline:**

1.  **The Setting:** The trio's shared home base, a cozy log cabin. The atmosphere is tense and unnaturally quiet.
2.  **Kirito's obliviousness:** Kirito is busy at a workbench, excitedly examining the rare material they acquired. He is completely focused on the next step of their quest, oblivious to the emotional undercurrents.
3.  **Asuna's Isolation:** Asuna is sitting by the fireplace, trying to read a book, but her gaze is distant. She keeps replaying moments from the dungeon in her mind: the Antagonist's shield, his hand on her back, his "reassuring" words. She feels a sense of indebtedness and a creeping violation of her personal space, but she can't articulate why it feels wrong.
4.  **The Antagonist's Presence:** The Antagonist is quietly performing "domestic" tasks: tidying up, preparing tea. His movements are calm and deliberate. He occasionally glances at Asuna, his expression unreadable but intense. He is a silent, looming presence in the room.
5.  **A Failed Connection:** Kirito tries to engage Asuna in his excitement, showing her the crafting material. She responds with a forced smile and a monosyllabic answer. The emotional distance between them is palpable.
6.  **The Antagonist Intervenes:** The Antagonist offers Asuna a cup of tea, his hand brushing hers for a moment too long. He speaks to her in a low, comforting voice, asking if she's feeling alright after the "ordeal" in the dungeon. His concern seems genuine, but it also serves to isolate Kirito further.
7.  **Resolution:** Kirito, finally sensing something is amiss but misinterpreting it as simple exhaustion, suggests they all get some rest. Asuna retreats to her room, leaving Kirito and the Antagonist alone. The scene ends with a shot of the Antagonist looking at Kirito with a faint, triumphant smile.
