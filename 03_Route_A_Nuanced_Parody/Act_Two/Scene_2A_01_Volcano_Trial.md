# Scene 2A-01: The Volcano Trial

**Objective:** Clear the "Volcanic Forge" dungeon to acquire a rare crafting material.

**Characters:**
*   Kirito
*   Asuna
*   Antagonist (now in a "Tank/Support" role)

**Scene Outline:**

1.  **The Setup:** The trio enters the dungeon. The environment is oppressive and dangerous, with lava flows and heat haze. Kirito is focused on the objective, strategizing as the party's damage dealer.
2.  **Forced Proximity:** The Antagonist's new abilities require him to stay close to Asuna, shielding her from environmental damage and enemy attacks. This creates a physical intimacy that is purely functional but visually suggestive.
    *   He uses a large shield to block a spray of lava, forcing them to huddle together.
    *   He casts a "cooling aura" that has a small radius, requiring Asuna to stay within his personal space.
3.  **Subtle Manipulation:** The Antagonist uses his support role to subtly undermine Kirito's leadership.
    *   He "helpfully" points out a "safer" path that happens to be more cramped, increasing the forced proximity with Asuna.
    *   He makes comments that frame his protective actions as a necessity born from Kirito's "reckless" focus on offense. ("Don't worry, I've got her. You focus on the fight.")
4.  **Kirito's Reaction:** Kirito is too absorbed in the fight to notice the subtle social dynamics at play. He sees the Antagonist's actions as efficient and helpful, even thanking him for his support. This highlights his emotional blind spot.
5.  **Asuna's Perspective:** Asuna feels a mixture of gratitude for the protection and a growing unease. The Antagonist's constant presence is both reassuring and suffocating. She notices the intimacy but dismisses it as a gameplay necessity.
6.  **Climax:** During a mini-boss fight, the Antagonist "sacrifices" a significant portion of his health to shield Asuna from a powerful attack Kirito failed to intercept. The act is heroic, but also serves to indebt Asuna to him further.
7.  **Resolution:** They clear the dungeon. Kirito is pleased with their success. Asuna is quiet and contemplative. The Antagonist has successfully used the trial to establish a new, more intimate and "necessary" position in the party dynamic.
