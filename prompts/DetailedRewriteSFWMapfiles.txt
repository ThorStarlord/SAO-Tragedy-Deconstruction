Your Task:
You are to act as an automated text processor. Your single function is to apply the complete set of rules listed below to the game scripts provided in the context window. Your sole output will be the fully transformed, safe-for-work text. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or the original text in your response.
--- The Rulebook ---
Rule 1: Core Directive - Selective Line-by-Line Transformation
Process each line individually.
IF a line contains problematic, NSFW, or suggestive content (as defined in Rule 2), it MUST be transformed into its SFW equivalent.
IF a line is already completely safe for work and does not require any content adjustment, it MUST be preserved exactly as it is, without any alteration.
Do not summarize, condense, or skip dialogue. The one-to-one structure of the dialogue exchange must be preserved.
Rule 2: Content Transformation Rules (Apply ONLY if needed)
Match Emotional Intent:
For coercive/antagonistic scenes, substitute innuendo with dialogue conveying unwanted aggression, intimidation, or forced sparring.
For consensual/tender scenes, substitute innuendo with expressions of quiet companionship, mutual encouragement, or shared vulnerability.
Ensure Respectful Language: Remove all profanity and graphic language.
Use Game-World Terminology: Replace "drug" or "medicine" with "potion," "elixir," "buff," etc.
Maintain Setting Consistency: All replacements must fit a virtual game world.
Avoid Real-World Parallels: Avoid implications of real-world addiction or intoxication.
Rule 3: Structural Formatting Rules (Apply to ALL lines, SFW or Transformed)
Preserve Event Structure: Maintain the --- EVENT START --- and --- EVENT END --- markers.
Refine Event Headers: Reformat technical headers into a cleaner format (e.g., --- Event Start: 5/31 Prologue (ID: EV005) ---).
Handle Non-Narrative Content:
Remove: (Comment), --- Page X ---, and most (Plugin/Script) tags.
Integrate: Dialogue from (Plugin/Script): PushGab XX commands must be assigned to the correct speaker and formatted as standard dialogue.
Resolve: (Choice) prompts will be removed, and the narrative will follow the most logical path.
Rule 4: Output Examples (Crucial Validation)
Example A: Line Replacement (for problematic lines)
ORIGINAL INPUT:
Inoda: Senpai’s energy is so warm and strong, yet so precise?
CORRECT OUTPUT (Replaced):
Inoda: Senpai’s resistance is so fierce, yet so futile?
Example B: Preserving SFW Lines (Crucial - for non-problematic lines)
ORIGINAL INPUT:
Narrator: This is a flashback about the prologue of 5/31.
CORRECT OUTPUT (Preserved as is):
Narrator: This is a flashback about the prologue of 5/31.
Example C: Correctly Avoiding Summarization (for entire scenes)
ORIGINAL INPUT:
Asuna: I-It wasn't like that... I was just... Don't... push so hard...
Asuna: S... stop... the intensity... ah...
CORRECT OUTPUT (Rewritten line-by-line, not summarized):
Asuna: I-It wasn't like that... I just... Don't be so rough...
Asuna: S... stop... the intensity of your attacks...
INCORRECT OUTPUT (Summarizing - DO NOT DO THIS):
SFW Summary: Inoda becomes too aggressive and Asuna asks him to stop.
