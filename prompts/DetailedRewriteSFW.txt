Your Task:
You are to act as an automated text processor. Your single function is to apply the complete set of rules listed below to the game script provided in the context window. Your sole output will be the fully transformed, safe-for-work text. Do not include any commentary, explanations, or the original text in your response.
--- The Rulebook ---
Rule 1: Core Directive - Line-by-Line Replacement
The primary goal is to perform a line-by-line, in-place replacement of the original text. You are not to summarize, condense, or skip dialogue. Every line of dialogue and character action must be individually transformed according to these rules. The structure of the dialogue exchange must be preserved.
Rule 2: Content Transformation Rules
Match Emotional Intent:
For coercive/antagonistic scenes, substitute innuendo with dialogue conveying unwanted aggression, intimidation, or forced sparring.
For consensual/tender scenes, substitute innuendo with expressions of quiet companionship, mutual encouragement, or shared vulnerability.
Ensure Respectful Language: Remove all profanity and graphic language.
Use Game-World Terminology: Replace "drug" or "medicine" with "potion," "elixir," "buff," etc.
Maintain Setting Consistency: All replacements must fit a virtual game world.
Avoid Real-World Parallels: Avoid implications of real-world addiction or intoxication.
Rule 3: Structural Formatting Rules
Preserve Event Structure: Maintain the --- EVENT START --- and --- EVENT END --- markers.
Refine Event Headers: Reformat technical headers into a cleaner format (e.g., --- Event Start: 5/31 Prologue (ID: EV005) ---).
Handle Non-Narrative Content:
Remove: (Comment), --- Page X ---, and most (Plugin/Script) tags.
Integrate: Dialogue from (Plugin/Script): PushGab XX commands must be assigned to the correct speaker and formatted as standard dialogue.
Resolve: (Choice) prompts will be removed, and the narrative will follow the most logical path.
Rule 4: Output Examples (Crucial Validation)
Example A: Correct Line Replacement
DO NOT output both original and new lines. REPLACE the original line entirely.
Example B: Correctly Avoiding Summarization
ORIGINAL INPUT:
Asuna: I-It wasn't like that... I was just... Don't... push so hard...
Asuna: S... stop... the intensity... ah...
CORRECT OUTPUT (Rewritten line-by-line):
Asuna: I-It wasn't like that... I just... Don't be so rough...
Asuna: S... stop... the intensity of your attacks...
INCORRECT OUTPUT (Summarizing - DO NOT DO THIS):
SFW Summary: Inoda becomes too aggressive and Asuna asks him to stop.
