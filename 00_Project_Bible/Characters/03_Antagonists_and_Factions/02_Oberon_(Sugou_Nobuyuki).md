# Oberon (Sugou Nobuyuki)

## FujinoVerse Parody Version

Based on a comprehensive analysis of all provided game files, here is a detailed profile of the character **Oberon / Nobuyuki Sugou**.

### Character Identity & Aliases

*   **Primary Name:** Oberon. This is the name he uses in his high-level meetings with the Axiom Church/organization leaders.
*   **Real Name:** Nobuyuki Sugou. This is confirmed in various dialogues, including Kirito and Asuna's conversations and comments from RECT employees, linking him directly to his canonical identity.
*   **Title:** Fairy King (implied). His use of "Titania" for Asuna is a direct reference to his role as Oberon, the Fairy King, in Alfheim Online (ALO), highlighting his continued delusions of grandeur.

### Role in the Story

Oberon is a major antagonist, collaborating with the organization led by the Administrator and the Six Beasts. His role is highly specialized:

1.  **Memory Modification Expert:** He is the lead technician on a project to edit and modify the memories of a key character, **Alice**. He refers to his work as "brain artistry," contrasting it with the "shoddy" hypnosis methods used by Shadow Fox.
2.  **Technological Mastermind:** His expertise lies in manipulating the core functions of FullDive technology. He possesses a deep understanding of how to influence memory, thought, and emotion at a neurological level, a skill he developed during the SAO incident.
3.  **High-Level Conspirator:** He is a key partner in a plot orchestrated by Shadow Fox to frame and ruin Kirito. The plan involves drugging Kirito, forcing him to commit despicable acts, and broadcasting the footage to destroy his reputation and get him arrested.
4.  **Past Nemesis:** He is the source of Asuna's most significant trauma. The game features a direct memory flashback to his abuse of her in ALO, where he kept her captive. This backstory is crucial to understanding his motivations and his relationship with both Kirito and Asuna.

### Personality & Traits

*   **Arrogant & Egotistical:** Oberon has an immense ego, viewing his skills as "artistry" and dismissing the work of others. He is condescending and dismissive towards his collaborator, Shadow Fox, and holds nothing but contempt for Kirito, whom he calls a "lucky bastard peasant."
*   **Sadistic & Cruel:** He takes explicit pleasure in the psychological and emotional suffering of others. In the flashback, he enjoys Asuna's despair, calling her expression "beautiful" and wishing to "freeze it and preserve it forever."
*   **Obsessive & Possessive:** His obsession with Asuna is a core part of his character. He still refers to her as "Titania" and his "wife," expressing a desire to "reclaim her." This fixation fuels his intense hatred for Kirito.
*   **Unscrupulous & Amoral:** He has no ethical boundaries. He views the thousands of players trapped in SAO not as victims, but as a convenient pool of "test subjects" for his illegal brain-control experiments.

### Goals and Motivations

1.  **Perfecting Memory & Mind Control:** This is his ultimate ambition. He seeks to master the technology to rewrite human memory and control emotions, believing this to be the true potential of the FullDive system that Kayaba Akihiko "wasted" on a mere game.
2.  **Acquiring Kirito's "Estate in His Mind":** The plot to frame Kirito is designed so the organization can seize something valuable he possesses. Given the context of SAO, this is almost certainly **The SEED**, the program that allows for the creation of new VR worlds.
3.  **Integrating ALO into FOG:** He explicitly discusses a plan with Shadow Fox to integrate the core code of his failed world, Alfheim Online, into the new, more advanced FOG system, demonstrating his desire to rebuild his lost kingdom.
4.  **Revenge on Kirito & Reclaiming Asuna:** A deeply personal vendetta. Defeating and humiliating Kirito is not just a means to an end but a goal in itself, driven by his obsessive "love" for Asuna and his hatred for the one who thwarted him.

### Key Relationships

*   **Asuna:** His primary obsession. He is the source of her trauma from his time as Oberon in ALO, where he held her captive. He still refers to her by the pet name "Titania."
*   **Kirito:** His arch-nemesis. He despises Kirito for defeating him and winning Asuna's affection. The plot to frame him is driven by both strategic need (to get The SEED) and personal hatred.
*   **Shadow Fox Scuray:** A key collaborator in the current plot, but their relationship is fraught with tension and mutual disrespect. Oberon sees Shadow Fox's methods as crude, while Shadow Fox sees Oberon as an arrogant but necessary specialist.
*   **The Administrator & The Six Beasts:** He is working with this organization, providing his technical expertise in memory modification in exchange for resources and the opportunity to advance his own agenda. He seems to operate on a similar level of authority as the Six Beasts in their joint projects.
*   **Alice:** His current test subject. He is performing memory modification on her, but the process is proving difficult due to her mental resilience and the flawed hypnotic preparation done by Shadow Fox's team.
