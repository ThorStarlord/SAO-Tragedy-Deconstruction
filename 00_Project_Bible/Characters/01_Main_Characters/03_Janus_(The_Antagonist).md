*   **Name:** Makoto (Real Name) / Janus (Online Alias)
*   **Alignment:** Neutral. His morality is shaped by Kirito's choices, pushing him toward either a twisted form of "support" or overt emotional manipulation.
*   **Personality:**
    *   **Public Persona (Makoto - "Truth," "Sincerity"):** The face he shows the world, particularly Asuna. He appears genuinely helpful, deeply understanding, and even pathetic. He leverages his seemingly "sincere" vulnerabilities to disarm, build trust, and draw empathy. This persona is a weaponized form of emotional honesty.
    *   **True Nature (Janus - "Duality," "Transitions"):** His online persona and true, calculating nature. As Janus, he is the god of his own small domain, opening doors for Asuna that she wouldn't otherwise walk through. He is the architect of psychological shifts and the keeper of uncomfortable truths, embodying the conflict between a public facade and private desires.
*   **Backstory:** Once a prodigy in the arcane arts, Makoto was cast out from his order for refusing to take sides in a centuries-old conflict. He has wandered the virtual world as an outsider, surviving by his wits and charm. His neutrality is a shield against the pain of past betrayals and a way to avoid being used as a pawn. Makoto is both ambitious and deeply lonely, craving genuine connection but wary of trusting anyone fully. This makes him a perfect opportunist.
*   **Motivation:** Self-interest and a desire for connection. He is an opportunist who exploits the emotional vacuum left by Kirito, not a pre-meditated evil villain. His core drive is to find a place where he belongs and prove his own worth, making him both a survivor and a subtle manipulator. He seeks leverage but secretly hopes for someone who sees him for who he truly is.

## Class: Incubus Warlock
Janus’s class is the Incubus Warlock, a unique support/control archetype whose power is directly tied to his emotional and physical connections with female characters. The more deeply he is connected to a female character—and the greater the number of such connections—the more his abilities and influence grow. This mechanic is both narrative and mechanical: his strength, skills, and even his ability to manipulate events scale with the intensity and quantity of his bonds.

**Class Mechanic:**
- Power increases with each female character he is emotionally or physically linked to.
- The more connections (and the deeper the intimacy), the greater his magical and psychological influence.
- This system incentivizes Janus to pursue, maintain, and deepen multiple relationships, making him a constant threat to the protagonists’ bonds.

## Roles in Each Route
- **Route 0 (Shared Descent):** Janus is a mysterious new ally whose growing influence subtly destabilizes the group dynamic.
- **Route A (Nuanced Parody):** He is a realistic manipulator, exploiting emotional gaps without overt supernatural force.
- **Route B (Exaggerated Satire):** Janus becomes a parody of the genre’s “NTR villain,” using his class mechanics in absurd, over-the-top ways.
- **Route C (Erotic Fiction):** His class’s power is most explicit, with intimacy and desire directly fueling his abilities and the story’s erotic tension.
- **Route D (Psychological Horror):** Janus’s connections become a source of psychological domination, eroding the protagonists’ sense of self and reality.
- **Route E (Psychological Thriller):** He is a master manipulator, using his network of connections to plant false memories and orchestrate mind games.
- **Route F (Tragedy):** Janus’s growing power and web of relationships drive the group toward inevitable ruin, embodying the tragic cost of broken bonds.

*   **Role in the Narrative:** He acts as a living mirror to Kirito's emotional and logical failures. He doesn't win by force, but by outmaneuvering the protagonist emotionally, making him a challenge to Asuna's ideals and Kirito's certainty.
