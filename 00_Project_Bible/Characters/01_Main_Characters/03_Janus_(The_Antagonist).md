*   **Name:** Makoto (Real Name) / Janus (Online Alias)
*   **Alignment:** Neutral. His morality is shaped by Kirito's choices, pushing him toward either a twisted form of "support" or overt emotional manipulation.
*   **Personality:**
    *   **Public Persona (Makoto - "Truth," "Sincerity"):** The face he shows the world, particularly Asuna. He appears genuinely helpful, deeply understanding, and even pathetic. He leverages his seemingly "sincere" vulnerabilities to disarm, build trust, and draw empathy. This persona is a weaponized form of emotional honesty.
    *   **True Nature (Janus - "Duality," "Transitions"):** His online persona and true, calculating nature. As Janus, he is the god of his own small domain, opening doors for Asuna that she wouldn't otherwise walk through. He is the architect of psychological shifts and the keeper of uncomfortable truths, embodying the conflict between a public facade and private desires.
*   **Backstory:** Once a prodigy in the arcane arts, Makoto was cast out from his order for refusing to take sides in a centuries-old conflict. He has wandered the virtual world as an outsider, surviving by his wits and charm. His neutrality is a shield against the pain of past betrayals and a way to avoid being used as a pawn. Makoto is both ambitious and deeply lonely, craving genuine connection but wary of trusting anyone fully. This makes him a perfect opportunist.
*   **Motivation:** Self-interest and a desire for connection. He is an opportunist who exploits the emotional vacuum left by Kirito, not a pre-meditated evil villain. His core drive is to find a place where he belongs and prove his own worth, making him both a survivor and a subtle manipulator. He seeks leverage but secretly hopes for someone who sees him for who he truly is.

## Class: Incubus Warlock
Janus’s class is the Incubus Warlock, a unique support/control archetype whose power is directly tied to his emotional and physical connections with female characters. The more deeply he is connected to a female character—and the greater the number of such connections—the more his abilities and influence grow. This mechanic is both narrative and mechanical: his strength, skills, and even his ability to manipulate events scale with the intensity and quantity of his bonds.

**Class Mechanic:**
- Power increases with each female character he is emotionally or physically linked to.
- The more connections (and the deeper the intimacy), the greater his magical and psychological influence.
- This system incentivizes Janus to pursue, maintain, and deepen multiple relationships, making him a constant threat to the protagonists’ bonds.

## Roles in Each Route
- **Route 0 (Shared Descent):** Janus is a mysterious new ally whose growing influence subtly destabilizes the group dynamic.
- **Route A (Nuanced Parody):** He is a realistic manipulator, exploiting emotional gaps without overt supernatural force.
- **Route B (Exaggerated Satire):** Janus becomes a parody of the genre’s “NTR villain,” using his class mechanics in absurd, over-the-top ways.
- **Route C (Erotic Fiction):** His class’s power is most explicit, with intimacy and desire directly fueling his abilities and the story’s erotic tension.
- **Route D (Psychological Horror):** Janus’s connections become a source of psychological domination, eroding the protagonists’ sense of self and reality.
- **Route E (Psychological Thriller):** He is a master manipulator, using his network of connections to plant false memories and orchestrate mind games.
- **Route F (Tragedy):** Janus’s growing power and web of relationships drive the group toward inevitable ruin, embodying the tragic cost of broken bonds.

*   **Role in the Narrative:** He acts as a living mirror to Kirito's emotional and logical failures. He doesn't win by force, but by outmaneuvering the protagonist emotionally, making him a challenge to Asuna's ideals and Kirito's certainty.

## Primary Method of Manipulation: The Eroticism of Logic

Janus's core strategy is not based on overt emotional appeals or physical dominance. He employs a highly sophisticated form of psychological seduction that targets his victim's intellect and rationality. This method has several key components:

- **Intellectual Validation:** Janus begins by establishing himself as an intellectual peer. He validates the target's intelligence, engages them in complex discussions (philosophy, ethics, logic), and treats them as a rational equal. This builds a foundation of trust and respect, bypassing emotional defenses.

- **Framing Betrayal as a Logical Imperative:** He systematically reframes transgressive acts not as moral failures, but as the most logical and "optimal" solutions to a given problem. Janus constructs complex, internally consistent (but emotionally manipulative) arguments that lead to a predetermined, compromising conclusion. His goal is to make the target feel that rejecting his conclusion would be an irrational act.

- **Weaponizing the Target's Own Intellect:** Janus often "teaches" his target the very logical frameworks he intends to use against them. This forces the target to engage with his arguments on his terms. Their own intelligence becomes a tool for their own entrapment, as they can find no logical flaw in his twisted premises.

- **Seduction through Intellectual Submission:** The "arousal" Janus generates in his target is not primarily physical. It is the thrill of intellectual intimacy and the heady feeling of being mentally outmaneuvered. The moment of "surrender" for his target is often not physical, but the moment they concede a logical point, admitting that his argument is unbeatable. This intellectual submission is treated as the most profound form of intimacy.

> **LLM Instruction:** When writing scenes involving Janus's manipulation of an intelligent character like Asuna, prioritize dialogue that reflects this method. His arguments should be calm, well-reasoned, and appeal to her logic, not her pity. Her downfall should feel like a series of "logical" concessions that lead her down a path of emotional and moral ruin. Avoid having him use the same melodramatic or pity-based tactics as a less sophisticated manipulator like Inoda.
