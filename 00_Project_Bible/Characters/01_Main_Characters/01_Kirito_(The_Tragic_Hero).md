*   **Role:** The protagonist and player surrogate.
*   **Canon Personality:** Based on his original depiction, Kirito is generally kind-hearted but socially awkward, often preferring to act as a solo player. He is direct, sometimes to the point of being blunt, but fiercely protective of those he cares for. His confidence in his gaming abilities is immense, yet it's contrasted by a deep-seated trauma and guilt complex stemming from past failures and losses, most notably the fate of the Moonlit Black Cats guild.
*   **The Tragic Flaw: "The Optimizer's Blind Spot"**
    *   **Detailed Explanation:** Kirito's flaw is not malice; it's a cognitive framework. He defaults to logic, data, and efficiency in all situations, treating emotional problems as systems to be debugged rather than experiences to be shared. He approaches interpersonal conflicts by trying to find the most "optimal" solution to end the disagreement quickly, which invariably involves dismissing or invalidating the emotions he cannot quantify. To him, feelings are messy, irrational variables that obstruct a clear, logical outcome. He isn't trying to be hurtful; he is tragically unqualified for the emotional challenges presented, relying on the only toolset he trusts: analysis and execution.
    *   **Manifestations (Non-NTR Context):**
        1.  **A Simple Argument:** Asuna confronts Kirito, upset that he recklessly charged into a high-level area alone without telling her. She's scared of losing him. Kirito, missing the emotional core of her fear, would respond by presenting a flawless logical breakdown of his actions. He'd show her his stat build, the enemy's predictable pathing, his potion inventory, and the calculated (and low) probability of failure. He would earnestly believe he is addressing her concern by proving the risk was negligible, completely failing to see that she isn't asking for a risk assessment; she's asking for a partner who considers her feelings.
        2.  **Handling Grief:** A supporting character is devastated after a beloved pet monster is killed in a dungeon. Kirito's attempt to "help" would be to immediately open the monster-taming interface and present a list of new, statistically superior pets they could acquire nearby. He would point out their higher DPS, better defensive stats, and faster respawn timers, seeing this as a perfect, efficient solution to the "problem" of the player's sadness. He would be genuinely confused when this makes the person even more upset, as he has offered a logical upgrade and cannot process that the issue is emotional loss, not a vacant roster slot.
