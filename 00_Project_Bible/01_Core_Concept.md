This game is a meta-commentary on the Fujino SAO NTR Parody. It functions as a deconstruction of both the original SAO and the tropes of the NTR genre. The central thesis is that Kirito's greatest strength—his skill as a gamer—is his greatest weakness as a partner. The player, as Kirito, will make choices that seem tactically optimal for "winning the game" but are emotionally catastrophic, making the player the architect of their own tragedy.
