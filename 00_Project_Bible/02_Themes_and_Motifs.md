*   **Primary Theme:** The failure of logic in the face of emotional needs.
*   **Multiple Lenses:** The game explores its themes through six distinct routes, each with a unique approach:
    *   **Route A:** Nuanced parody, treating the tragedy seriously.
    *   **Route B:** Exaggerated satire, mocking the absurdity of the genre's mechanics.
    *   **Route C:** Erotic fiction, focusing on desire, temptation, and ambiguous morality.
    *   **Route D:** Psychological horror, exploring terror, helplessness, and loss of self.
    *   **Route E:** Psychological thriller, emphasizing manipulation, suspense, and betrayal.
    *   **Route F:** Tragedy, highlighting emotional vulnerability and inevitable downfall.
*   **Agency and Responsibility:** The story explores Asuna's agency as a reaction to Kirito's actions and her own sense of duty.
*   **Dramatic Irony:** The core narrative device. The player (as Kirito) has limited information, while the audience is shown the full picture of the betrayal, creating sustained tension and dread.
*   **Duality (Embodied by Makoto/Janus):** The antagonist personifies the story's central conflicts:
    *   **Truth vs. Deceit:** His real name (Makoto) means "truth," while his actions are manipulative.
    *   **Public vs. Private:** He represents the secret life and hidden desires that conflict with public personas.
    *   **Kirito's Flaw:** Kirito's choice of Janus's class path (Support or DPS) directly shapes the nature of his own downfall, making him the architect of his own tragedy.
