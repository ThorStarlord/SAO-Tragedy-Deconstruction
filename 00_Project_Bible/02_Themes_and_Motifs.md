*   **Primary Theme:** The failure of logic in the face of emotional needs.
*   **Parody vs. Satire:** The game explores this theme through two lenses. Route A is a nuanced parody that treats the tragedy seriously. Route B is an exaggerated satire that mocks the absurdity of the genre's mechanics.
*   **Agency and Responsibility:** The story explores Asuna's agency as a reaction to Kirito's actions and her own sense of duty.
*   **Dramatic Irony:** The core narrative device. The player (as Kirito) has limited information, while the audience is shown the full picture of the betrayal, creating sustained tension and dread.
*   **Duality (Embodied by Makoto/Janus):** The antagonist personifies the story's central conflicts:
    *   **Truth vs. Deceit:** His real name (Makoto) means "truth," while his actions are manipulative.
    *   **Public vs. Private:** He represents the secret life and hidden desires that conflict with public personas.
    *   **Kirito's Flaw:** Kirito's choice of Janus's class path (Support or DPS) directly shapes the nature of his own downfall, making him the architect of his own tragedy.
