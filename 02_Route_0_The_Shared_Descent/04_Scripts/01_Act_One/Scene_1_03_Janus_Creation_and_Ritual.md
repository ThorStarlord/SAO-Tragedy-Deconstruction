**(SCENE START)**

**INT. FOG ONLINE - GENESIS PLAZA - NIGHT**

Makoto, now in the form of his newly created avatar, stands awkwardly between Kirito and Asuna. He chose the default male template: tall, dark-haired, and generically handsome. He hasn't customized a thing.

A system prompt hangs in the air before him.
`[Please enter your character name.]`

**ASUNA**
(Warmly)
> Do you have a name in mind?

**MAKOTO**
(Hesitates, looking down)
> I... I'm not sure. I've never been good at this kind of thing.

**KIRITO**
(Impatiently)
> Just pick something. The name doesn't affect your stats. We've got a quest to get started on.

Asuna gives Kirito a pointed look. He shrugs. Makoto looks from one to the other, then types slowly. The name **JANUS** appears above his head.

**ASUNA**
> Janus? The two-faced god of beginnings and endings. That's a very thoughtful name.

**JANUS**
(A small, shy smile)
> I... I've always liked the idea of new beginnings.

A quest notification pings for all three of them.
`[New Quest: A Destiny Unwritten]`
`[Objective: Open the Box of Latent Potential at the Altar of Possibility.]`

Kirito's eyes light up.

**KIRITO**
> Ah, the class-granting quest. This is it. This is the most critical step in your build. Most players just open the box, but that's a mistake. The outcome is influenced by the ritual you perform.

He leads them to a glowing altar where a simple, unadorned chest restsâ€”the "Box of Latent Potential."

**KIRITO**
> Based on the beta forums, the "Ritual of Calculated Risk" has the highest probability of yielding a top-tier DPS or Tank class. It requires a precise sequence of emotes and item offerings. Just follow my lead exactly. We can't afford any variance.

Kirito begins the ritual, a series of complex gestures. Asuna follows along, assisting. Janus, however, hesitates for a moment. He looks at the box, then at Kirito's back, then at Asuna. A flicker of uncertainty crosses his face.

**JANUS**
(Quietly)
> Are you sure this is the best way? It feels... impersonal.

**KIRITO**
(Without turning)
> Trust me, I've run the numbers. Emotion doesn't factor into the loot table.

Reluctantly, Janus mimics Kirito's final gesture. The box on the altar begins to shake. It cracks open, but instead of the brilliant gold or solid blue light Kirito expects, a faint, almost sickly **crimson glow** seeps out, bathing the three of them in its unsettling light.

A new screen appears before Janus.
`[Congratulations! You have been granted the Unique Class: INCUBUS WARLOCK]`

Kirito's confident expression immediately sours. He brings up the class details, his brow furrowed.

**KIRITO**
> Incubus Warlock? What even is that? Let me see the base stats...

He scans the screen, and his face falls into disappointment.

**KIRITO**
> Pathetic. Attack power is abysmal, defense is paper-thin. It's a debuff and support class. All that planning for... this.

He sighs, clearly frustrated. The "optimal" path failed.

Asuna, however, steps closer to Janus, her expression gentle. She's not looking at the stats. She's looking at him.

**ASUNA**
> Don't listen to him. Every class has its own potential. It doesn't matter if you're not a DPS or a tank. We'll find a place for you. We're a team now.

Janus looks up at her, the crimson light reflecting in his eyes. The shy, grateful expression returns, but this time it's mixed with something else. A quiet confidence. He found his place not through Kirito's logic, but through Asuna's kindness.
