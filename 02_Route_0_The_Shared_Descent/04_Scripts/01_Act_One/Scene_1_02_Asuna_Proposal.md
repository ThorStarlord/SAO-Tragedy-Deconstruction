**(SCENE START)**

**EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - AFTERNOON**

Kirito and Asuna walk side-by-side along a tree-lined path, their school bags slung over their shoulders. Kirito is explaining his revised DPS calculations from lunch, gesturing with his hands.

**KIRITO**
> ...so if I swap the crit-chance crystal for a pure attack-power one, my sustained damage goes up by nearly seven percent. The trade-off is burst potential, but for longer fights, it's a net gain.

Asuna is nodding along, but her attention is elsewhere. She stops walking, and Kirito continues a few steps before realizing she's no longer beside him. He turns, a questioning look on his face.

**ASUNA**
> I was thinking about what we discussed at lunch. About Makoto-kun.

**KIRITO**
(Slightly impatient)
> Him again? Asuna, I'm sure he's—

**ASUNA**
(Interrupting, her voice earnest)
> I know what it's like to feel invisible. To have your world decided for you by someone else. Maybe... maybe we could invite him to play FOG with us? Show him a place where he can be someone else. Where he can find a voice.

Kirito stares at her, his expression shifting to one of mild disbelief.

**KIRITO**
> A complete newbie? Asuna, we're trying to clear the new raid tier. The time sink to get him up to speed would be massive. It would kill our progression.

**ASUNA**
(A flash of frustration in her eyes)
> It's not about progression, Kirito-kun. It's about helping someone. It's the right thing to do.

Kirito looks away, considering her words. His "optimizer" brain, initially rejecting the idea as inefficient, starts processing it from a different angle. A long-term strategic one. A thoughtful silence hangs between them.

Then, his eyes light up with a sudden, brilliant idea. He turns back to her, his previous annoyance gone, replaced by genuine excitement.

**KIRITO**
> Wait. A blank slate. No bad habits from other games. We could mold him from the ground up. Build him perfectly for our party composition. He could be a dedicated tank, or a pure support... someone we don't have to use the Party Finder for. We could power-level him through the early zones in a weekend.

He takes a step closer, his voice filled with the passion he usually reserves for a rare item drop.

**KIRITO**
> The long-term efficiency gains would be huge! Asuna... you're a genius!

He beams at her, completely oblivious that he's praising her for a cold, tactical insight she never intended.

Asuna is visibly taken aback. Her expression is a complex mix of disappointment and relief. It wasn't the reason she wanted, but it's the outcome she hoped for. She forces a smile.

**ASUNA**
> Right... efficiency. So, you'll do it?

**KIRITO**
(Already pulling out his phone)
> Of course. The logic is sound. Let's call this 'Operation: Recruit Asset'. No, wait... 'Project Janus'. That has a better ring to it.

He starts typing a message to Makoto, a focused, determined look on his face. He is no longer helping a lonely classmate; he is managing a new project.

Asuna watches him, her forced smile fading into something more contemplative and a little sad. She got what she wanted, but the gap between their perspectives feels wider than ever.

## 🧭 Scene Purpose

This scene reveals the emotional gap forming between Kirito and Asuna. Asuna proposes inviting Janus to join their FOG party — not from strategy, but **from empathy**. Kirito misunderstands her motivation and views Janus only as an “optimizable” asset. This misalignment is the first **major crack** in their bond.

---

## 🧩 Narrative Summary

Asuna brings up Janus over lunch, trying to verbalize the quiet sense of pain or loneliness she saw in him. She wants to reach out and support him as a person. Kirito, well-meaning but blind, interprets this as a great opportunity to build a perfect party member. His enthusiasm overpowers Asuna’s emotional framing, unintentionally sidelining her concern.

This is the first major example of **Kirito’s "optimizer blind spot"** in action — and the first moment Asuna realizes he might not see people the same way she does.

---

## 🎭 Character Dynamics

- **Asuna:** Struggling to articulate emotional instincts. Hopes Kirito will understand and align. Begins to feel dismissed.
- **Kirito:** Proud of Asuna, assumes shared values, misreads her compassion as tactical insight. Tragic flaw: rational empathy instead of emotional intuition.
- **Janus (offscreen):** The silent subject of growing emotional projection from both.

## 🧩 Scene Flow

### 1. Light Lunch, Heavy Silence

> *(Cafeteria, side booth. Kirito is midway through his bento. Asuna stares out the window.)*

**Kirito:**  
"Earth to Asuna. You haven’t touched your miso."

**Asuna:** *(startled)*  
"Oh — sorry. Just… thinking."

**Kirito:** *(smiles)*  
"Let me guess. Janus?"

**Asuna:** *(soft pause)*  
"Yeah."

*(Player choice – Kirito’s tone)*

> - [ ] “You like him already, huh?” *(teasing, ironic tone)*
> - [ ] “Same here. He’s raw but promising.” *(strategic tone)*
> - [ ] “Worried about him?” *(empathetic tone — unlocks alternate reply)*

---

### 2. The Proposal

**Asuna:**  
"He has this... emptiness behind his smile. Like someone still stuck between worlds."

**Kirito:** *(nods confidently)*  
"All the more reason to get him in the field. Combat’s the best therapy."

**Asuna:** *(a bit surprised)*  
"I mean — maybe. But I was thinking more like… friendship. Letting him know he's not alone."

**Kirito:** *(half-laughs)*  
"And what better way than inviting him to FOG? We can teach him, give him purpose. It’s efficient *and* meaningful."

**Asuna:** *(hesitates)*  
"Efficient..."

---

### 3. Misalignment

> *(Asuna’s hand lingers near her chopsticks. Kirito leans forward, excited.)*

**Kirito:**  
"Think about it. His potential synergy with our builds, the empty subclass slot, his affinity toward dark-type gear—he’s a blank canvas. We could do something no one else’s done."

**Asuna:**  
"..."

**Kirito:** *(smiling)*  
"Hey. This was your idea. You saw something in him, right?"

**Asuna:** *(quietly, to herself)*  
"Not that kind of something..."

---

## 🔁 Player Choice (Kirito's Framing)

> *Player chooses how Kirito seals the pitch. Each choice determines Asuna’s hidden trust level in Route 0.*

- [ ] "Let’s build him into someone great." *(Strategic path, trust -1)*
- [ ] "Let’s help him find himself." *(Balanced path, trust 0)*
- [ ] "Let’s make sure he doesn’t fall through the cracks like we almost did." *(Empathy path, trust +1)*

---

### 4. Fade Out

> *(Bell rings. Students start to clear the cafeteria. Asuna picks up her tray.)*

**Asuna (V.O.):**  
"I thought he’d understand. That maybe we still spoke the same language. But sometimes, it feels like Kirito’s always solving a puzzle... even when I’m just trying to share a feeling."

---

## 🧠 Notes for Future Payoff

- **Miscommunication** is the route’s core wedge. This is the first of many moments where Kirito "agrees" with Asuna, while *missing her emotional intent* entirely.
- If the player consistently picks strategic or cold choices as Kirito, Route A will later frame Asuna’s emotional drift as inevitable — a “need unmet.”
- This is also an early inversion: Asuna is the one bringing Janus closer. This adds tragic irony when he later becomes the wedge between her and Kirito.

## 🔚 Scene End
*Asuna follows Kirito out of the cafeteria. He’s already talking about skill synergy. She lingers for just a second longer, eyes flicking to the hallway where Janus had passed earlier that day.*

Scene 1-02: Asuna’s Proposal
Date: April 7, 2025 (Day 1, Spring Term, FOG Online Pre-Launch)Location: Tokyo, High School Gaming Club Room, Late AfternoonPurpose: Establish Asuna’s initiative to include Makoto in the FOG Online party, highlight Kirito’s strategic priorities over emotional considerations, and deepen Makoto’s integration into the group dynamic.

The gaming club room hums with the soft whir of computers and the chatter of students testing VR headsets. Posters of FOG Online’s sprawling fantasy world adorn the walls, depicting misty forests and towering spires. Asuna stands near a table cluttered with VR gear, gesturing animatedly as she talks to Makoto, who clutches his backpack, eyes wide but attentive. Kirito sits at a nearby terminal, his fingers flying across a keyboard as he analyzes FOG Online’s class data on a glowing monitor.
Asuna: (enthusiastic) So, Makoto, I was thinking—why don’t you join our party for the FOG Online launch tomorrow? It’d be great to have you with us.
Makoto: (hesitant, shifting his weight) Me? I… I’m not sure. I’ve never played anything as big as FOG Online. I’d probably just slow you down.
Asuna: (smiling reassuringly) Don’t worry about that. We all start somewhere. Besides, Kirito and I have been through plenty of VRMMOs. We’ll help you get the hang of it.
Kirito glances over, his expression skeptical but curious. He pushes away from the terminal, leaning back in his chair.
Kirito: (raising an eyebrow) You’re serious about this, Asuna? A newbie in our launch party? We’re aiming to blitz the first zone, not babysit.
Asuna: (frowning, hands on hips) Kirito, don’t be like that. Makoto’s new, but he’s got potential. Plus, it’s more fun with friends, not just min-maxing everything.
Kirito: (shrugs, smirking) Fun’s great, but winning’s better. If he’s in, we need a role that fits our strategy. Tank, DPS, or support—something that doesn’t throw off our synergy.
Makoto’s shoulders slump slightly, his fingers tightening on his backpack strap. Asuna notices, her expression softening as she steps closer to him.
Makoto: (quietly) I don’t want to mess up your plans. Maybe I should just—
Asuna: (interrupting, gently) No way, Makoto. You’re not messing anything up. I think you’d be a great addition. Right, Kirito?
Kirito meets Asuna’s gaze, her eyes firm but pleading. He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck, then looks at Makoto, sizing him up.
Player Choice 1:  

A: Support Asuna’s idea enthusiastically. “Fine, he’s in. Let’s make it work, Makoto. We’ll find you a solid build.”  
B: Focus on strategy and conditions. “He can join, but only if he picks a class that fits our setup. No dead weight.”  
C: Reluctantly agree, prioritizing Asuna. “If it means that much to you, Asuna, he’s in. But he’s your responsibility.”

If A is chosen:Makoto: (brightening slightly) Really? Thanks, Kirito. I’ll do my best to keep up.Asuna: (beaming) That’s the spirit! We’ll all figure it out together.Kirito: (nodding) Alright, but we’re still optimizing. I’ll pull up some class guides tonight. Makoto, you better read fast.
If B is chosen:Makoto: (nervous) I-I’ll try to pick something useful. Maybe a support class? I don’t know…Asuna: (sighing) Kirito, give him a break. He doesn’t need to be perfect on day one.Kirito: (firmly) Day one sets the pace, Asuna. We can’t afford to lag behind the top guilds.
If C is chosen:Makoto: (quietly) I’ll try not to let you down, Asuna.Asuna: (smiling warmly) You won’t. I know you’ll do great. (to Kirito, pointedly) And we’ll all help him, right?Kirito: (grumbling) Yeah, yeah. Just don’t expect me to hold his hand through every quest.
Asuna pulls out her phone, showing Makoto a FOG Online trailer on the screen, her voice animated as she describes the game’s world. Makoto listens intently, his earlier nervousness easing, though his eyes occasionally flicker toward Kirito, who’s back at his terminal, typing furiously. A faint, unreadable expression crosses Makoto’s face—gratitude, perhaps, or something sharper—before he turns back to Asuna.
Narration: As the club room empties, Asuna and Makoto exchange contact info, planning to meet online tomorrow for the FOG Online launch. Kirito stays behind, lost in his data, oblivious to Asuna’s lingering glance. The trio’s dynamic takes shape: Asuna’s warmth drawing Makoto in, Kirito’s focus creating a subtle rift, and Makoto’s quiet presence hiding a spark of something deeper.

Foreshadowing Notes:  

Kirito’s prioritization of strategy over Asuna’s emotional appeal reinforces his optimizer’s blind spot, central to Routes A and B.  
Asuna’s advocacy for Makoto strengthens their bond, setting up her reliance on him in Routes A, C, and D.  
Makoto’s fleeting expression hints at his potential for manipulation (Routes C, D, F), masked by his shy demeanor.  
The calendar reference (April 7, 2025) aligns with 04_Calendar_System.md, marking the day before FOG Online’s launch.

Player Impact:  

Choices shape Kirito’s stance toward Makoto, influencing Asuna’s frustration or approval and setting the tone for Makoto’s integration.  
The scene deepens the player’s awareness of Kirito’s flaw and Asuna’s empathy, planting seeds for the tragic divergence at the Class Sanctum.
