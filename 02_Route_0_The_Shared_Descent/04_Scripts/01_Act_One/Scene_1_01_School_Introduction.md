# Route 0, Act 1, Scene 1: An Unassuming Lunch

**Setting:** A bright, noisy high school cafeteria during lunch break. Sunlight streams through large windows.
**Characters:** Kirito, Asuna, Makoto (Janus).
**Music:** A light, cheerful slice-of-life track.

---

**(SCENE START)**

**EXT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY**

The camera pans across the lively room, filled with the chatter of students. We find KIRITO and ASUNA sitting together at a two-person table near the window. Their rapport is easy and familiar.

Kirito is meticulously arranging his bento box, separating the vegetables from the meat with his chopsticks. He glances at his phone, propped up against a drink carton, displaying what looks like game patch notes.

**ASUNA**
(Smiling, a little amused)
> Are you optimizing your lunch again, Kirito-kun?

**KIRITO**
(Without looking up from his phone)
> Efficiency is key. The optimal intake order maximizes nutrient absorption and flavor contrast. It's just logical.

Asuna shakes her head with a fond sigh. Her gaze drifts across the cafeteria, past the boisterous friend groups and laughing couples. It lands on a table in the corner.

MAKOTO sits there alone. He's tall and has a quiet, handsome intensity, but his posture is closed off. He eats his lunch mechanically, his eyes fixed on a thick paperback book resting on the table. He seems entirely separate from the vibrant energy of the room.

**ASUNA**
(Voice softens)
> Look at him... Makoto-kun. He always eats alone.

Kirito glances up from his phone for a fraction of a second, his eyes finding Makoto, then immediately returns to the screen.

**KIRITO**
> Hm? Oh. The new transfer student.

His tone is neutral, dismissive. He’s already back to scrolling through the patch notes. Asuna’s gaze lingers on Makoto.

**ASUNA**
> It's more than that. It's the way he holds himself. Like he's trying to take up as little space as possible. It reminds me of... well, of how I used to feel. Trapped by expectations, afraid to connect with anyone.

She pauses, watching as Makoto carefully turns a page in his book. She can just make out the title on the spine. It looks like a dense textbook on behavioral psychology.

**ASUNA**
(Quietly, to herself)
> He seems so lonely.

Just then, Makoto looks up from his book, as if sensing her gaze. His eyes meet Asuna's across the cafeteria. For a moment, his expression is one of startled shyness, a deer caught in headlights.

But then, it shifts.

The shyness recedes, replaced by a gaze that is surprisingly direct, analytical, and intense. It holds for a beat too long, a silent acknowledgment that feels more profound than a simple glance. Kirito, still focused on his phone, misses the entire exchange.

Makoto breaks eye contact first, his head dipping back down to his book, a faint flush on his cheeks.

**PLAYER CHOICE: What is Kirito's response to Asuna's concern?**

1.  **(Optimizer)** "He's probably fine. Anyway, did you see they're nerfing the dual-wielding passive in the next FOG update? I need to recalculate my entire DPS build."
2.  **(Dismissive)** "I guess. Looks like he just wants to be left alone, Asuna. Not everyone is a party animal."
3.  **(Empathetic)** "You're right. It must be tough transferring in the middle of the year. He seems... walled off."

**(SCENE END)**

**NARRATIVE NOTES:**

*   **If Player Chooses 1 or 2:** Asuna's expression becomes slightly disappointed. She looks back at Makoto with a new sense of determination, firming her resolve to reach out to him herself. This directly sets up the next scene.
*   **If Player Chooses 3:** Asuna smiles warmly at Kirito, pleased by his understanding. Her resolve to help Makoto is now shared, though Kirito's motivation will quickly revert to optimization in the next scene. This choice could provide a minor "Relationship Point" boost, but does not alter the main tragic trajectory.

# Scene 1_01 – School Introduction  
**Route:** 0 – The Shared Descent  
**Act:** One  
**Location:** Real World – SAO Survivors’ Academy, early morning  
**Time:** April 10th, 7:35 AM

---

## 🧭 Scene Purpose

Introduce the **tone** of the SAO-Tragedy-Deconstruction world — a fragile peace built on post-trauma healing, veiled discontent, and unreconciled ideals.  
Establish the **emotional baselines** for Kirito, Asuna, and introduce Janus as a mysterious but harmless newcomer.  
Plant early seeds of Kirito’s **optimizer flaw**, and Asuna’s **emotional distance**.

---

## 🧩 Narrative Summary

Kirito and Asuna arrive at the survivors' school, appearing happy but subtly out of sync. Asuna is warm but distracted. Kirito is excited to meet someone who matches his game-optimization mindset. They encounter Janus — quiet, awkward, and polite. Kirito immediately sees tactical potential in him. Asuna, slightly unsettled, feels something strange but can't articulate it.  
Janus joins their group for the day.

---

## 🎭 Character Dynamics

- **Kirito:** Optimistic, analytical, emotionally blunt, proud of Asuna but preoccupied with game strategy and stats.
- **Asuna:** Caring, emotionally present but inwardly restless. Senses that Kirito doesn’t quite “see” her emotional needs.
- **Janus:** Shy, respectful, with a calm demeanor. He avoids eye contact, but listens carefully. Everything he says is polite — and yet hard to pin down.

---

## 🧩 Scene Flow

### 1. Arrival and Tension

> *(Outside the school gates. Students filter in. Kirito and Asuna walk together.)*

**Kirito:**  
"Hard to believe we’re back to the classroom grind after Aincrad, huh?"

**Asuna:** *(smiling softly)*  
"It’s… kind of nice. Normal."

**Kirito:**  
"Yeah. I just wish we had more serious parties in FOG. Too many casuals. Wasted potential."

**Asuna:** *(quiet pause)*  
"Right... wasted potential."

*(Player choice – Kirito’s response style)*

> - [ ] “I miss our old synergy. Want to duo again?” *(emotionally grounded)*
> - [ ] “Maybe we can train up a new member from scratch.” *(optimizing mindset)*
> - [ ] “You think that new guy Janus would be worth investing in?” *(foreshadowing)*

---

### 2. Meeting Janus

> *(Classroom. Janus stands near the back, quiet, flipping through the FOG rulebook.)*

**Kirito:** *(whispers to Asuna)*  
"That him? Janus, right? Top percentile on the entrance trial."

**Asuna:** *(tilting head)*  
"He seems... gentle."

**Janus:** *(not looking up)*  
"You must be Kirito and Asuna. It’s an honor to meet the Black Swordsman... and the Flash."

**Kirito:**  
"Didn’t know people still used those titles."

**Janus:** *(soft chuckle)*  
"Titles are... anchoring. Sometimes they help you remember who you were."

**Asuna:** *(stares at Janus, disturbed by the phrasing)*  
"Or make it harder to become someone new."

---

### 3. Subtle Power Shifts

> *(Later, the trio walks the school courtyard during break.)*

**Janus:** *(hesitant)*  
"If you don’t mind… I’d love to join you in FOG sometime. I’m not very skilled yet, but I learn quickly."

**Kirito:** *(immediately enthusiastic)*  
"Of course! A fresh mind is a blank slate. We’ll mold you into something great."

**Asuna:** *(halfhearted)*  
"You don’t have to push yourself too hard. It’s not all about numbers."

**Janus:** *(to Asuna, softly)*  
"I know. But sometimes numbers help you feel less… lost."

> *(Asuna glances sideways. Kirito nods approvingly, missing the emotional undercurrent.)*

---

## 🧠 Notes for Future Payoff

- Janus’s “titles are anchoring” line foreshadows his memory manipulation ideology.
- Kirito’s optimism blinds him to Asuna’s increasing discomfort with gamification of emotions.
- Asuna’s discomfort with Janus is never verbalized, but will slowly turn inward into guilt, desire, and repression in later scenes.
- Janus’s line “sometimes numbers help you feel less lost” is a **mirror** of Kirito’s optimizer flaw — and a **trap**.

## 🔚 Scene End
Scene ends with the three standing beneath a cherry blossom tree, petals falling as the bell rings. Asuna lingers. Kirito runs ahead. Janus waits silently at her side.

**Asuna (V.O.):**  
"Back then... I didn’t know what I was afraid of. Only that something soft had started to shift."

Scene 1-01: School Introduction
Date: April 7, 2025 (Day 1, Spring Term, FOG Online Pre-Launch)Location: Tokyo, High School Classroom, AfternoonPurpose: Introduce Kirito, Asuna, and Makoto, establish their initial dynamics, and set up Kirito’s optimization focus and Asuna’s empathy as the foundation for the tragedy.

The classroom buzzes with post-lunch chatter, sunlight streaming through tall windows onto rows of desks. Kirito leans back in his chair near the back, scrolling through a tablet displaying FOG Online’s beta patch notes. His dark hair falls messily over his eyes, which gleam with focus. Asuna sits two desks away, organizing her notebook, her auburn hair catching the light as she glances at Kirito with a mix of affection and exasperation. Near the door, Makoto lingers, a new transfer student, his slight frame hunched as he clutches a worn backpack, eyes darting nervously.
Asuna: (softly, to Kirito) You’ve been glued to that tablet all day. Don’t tell me you’re already planning our builds for FOG Online’s launch tomorrow.
Kirito: (grinning, not looking up) Guilty as charged. They tweaked the skill tree again. I’m thinking we go full DPS this time—maximize damage output, skip the fluff. Efficiency is king.
Asuna: (sighs, closing her notebook) It’s not just about efficiency, Kirito. It’s a game. We’re supposed to have fun, you know?
Kirito: (shrugs, still scrolling) Winning is fun. Trust me, I’ve got this. We’ll clear the first zone in record time.
Asuna frowns, her fingers tightening on her pen. She notices Makoto standing alone, his gaze fixed on the floor. She stands, smoothing her skirt, and approaches him.
Asuna: (warmly) Hey, you’re Makoto, right? I’m Asuna. Welcome to class. It must be tough transferring mid-term.
Makoto: (startled, voice soft) O-oh, yeah. Thanks. I’m… just trying to get used to things.
His eyes flicker to Asuna, then down again, a faint flush on his cheeks. Kirito glances up, noticing the interaction, and sets his tablet down.
Kirito: (casually) New guy, huh? You into games, Makoto? FOG Online’s dropping tomorrow. Biggest VRMMO launch in years.
Makoto: (hesitant) I’ve… played some. Not much. I heard FOG Online’s intense, though.
Kirito: (leans forward, smirking) Intense? It’s a battlefield. You either optimize or get left behind. You in, or you just here for the scenery?
Player Choice 1:  

A: Encourage Makoto to join the game. “You should team up with us. We could use a fresh perspective.”  
B: Focus on strategy. “If you join, we’ll need a solid build for you. Got any class preferences?”  
C: Dismiss him lightly. “No pressure, but it’s a grind. Only serious players last.”

If A is chosen:Asuna: (smiling) That’s a great idea! It’d be fun to have you, Makoto. We’ll show you the ropes.Makoto: (small smile) Really? I… I’d like that. I’m not great, but I’ll try.
If B is chosen:Asuna: (frowning slightly) Kirito, ease up. He just got here. Let him settle in before you start planning his build.Makoto: (nervous) I-I don’t know much about classes yet. I’d need to read up…Kirito: (nods) Fair. I’ll send you the beta guide tonight. Study it.
If C is chosen:Asuna: (sharply) Kirito! Don’t scare him off. (to Makoto) Ignore him. You’re welcome to join us if you want.Makoto: (quietly) Thanks, Asuna. I’ll… think about it.
Asuna sits beside Makoto, chatting softly about the school and FOG Online’s lore. Kirito watches, his expression unreadable, then returns to his tablet. Makoto’s eyes linger on Asuna, a fleeting intensity in his gaze that vanishes when he notices Kirito looking.
Narration: The bell rings, signaling the end of the day. Asuna offers to show Makoto the school’s gaming club room, while Kirito trails behind, already typing build notes into his tablet. The seeds of their dynamic are planted: Asuna’s warmth, Kirito’s focus, and Makoto’s quiet observation, hinting at something deeper beneath his shy exterior.

Foreshadowing Notes:  

Kirito’s obsession with optimization (tablet scrolling, DPS focus) sets up his neglect of Asuna’s emotional needs, central to Routes A and B.  
Asuna’s empathy toward Makoto foreshadows her reliance on him in Routes A, C, and D.  
Makoto’s intense glance hints at his potential manipulation (Routes C, D, F), subtle enough to blend with his shy demeanor.  
The calendar reference (April 7, 2025) ties to 04_Calendar_System.md, marking the pre-launch day of FOG Online.

Player Impact:  

Choices shape Kirito’s initial attitude toward Makoto, influencing Asuna’s perception of him (empathy vs. frustration).  
The scene establishes the emotional stakes, making players question Kirito’s priorities and notice Makoto’s subtle presence.
