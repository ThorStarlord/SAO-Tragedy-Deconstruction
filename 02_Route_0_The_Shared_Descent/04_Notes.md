# Route 0 Notes

- Use this file for brainstorming, development notes, and route-specific ideas.

## Notes on Foreshadowing
- **Real clues**: Emotional stats, system warnings, Asuna’s reactions.
- **False clues**: Kirito’s dismissals, W party trust variable.
- **Balance**: Each scene should have at least one real and one false clue, keeping the audience guessing and supporting the parody/satire tone.

---

Here are recommendations for your initial branching route, based on your project’s structure and goals:

---

### 1. What should this route be called?
- **Suggested Name:** “Prologue Route: The Flawed Foundation” or simply “The Flawed Foundation Route”
- This name matches your act title and signals to the reader/player that this is the shared starting point before the story branches.

---

### 2. What should be the size of the route (number of scenes)?
- **Recommended Size:** 4–6 scenes
  - 4 scenes is a minimum for establishing the world, characters, and the inciting incident.
  - 6 scenes allows for more character moments, foreshadowing, and a natural escalation to the branching point.
- Your current outline (in the file) already has 4 strong scenes. You could add 1–2 more for deeper character introduction or early tension if desired.

---

### 3. How much foreshadowing (clues and false clues) should this route have?
- **Foreshadowing:** Moderate, with a mix of real and misleading clues.
  - Each major route (tragedy, satire, erotic, etc.) should have at least one subtle hint in dialogue, character behavior, or game mechanics.
  - Include 1–2 “red herrings” (false clues) to keep the audience guessing and to support the parody/satire tone.
  - Example: The Warlock’s ambiguous comments, Asuna’s subtle reactions, or odd system messages.

---

### 4. How should this route start?
- **Best Approach:** Start with action (Yui’s data corruption crisis), but weave in character introductions and context as the crisis unfolds.
  - This hooks the audience immediately and allows you to introduce both canon and non-canon characters organically.
  - Use the crisis to show each character’s personality and role (e.g., Kirito’s logic, Asuna’s emotion, Janus’s introduction as the needed Warlock).
  - Parody elements can be layered in through dialogue, reactions, and the absurdity of the situation.

---

### Summary of Approach
- **Route Name:** “The Flawed Foundation Route” (or similar)
- **Scenes:** 4–6, as in your current outline, with room for expansion
- **Foreshadowing:** 1–2 real clues per major route, 1–2 false clues
- **Start:** With the Yui crisis, introducing characters and parody context through action and interaction
