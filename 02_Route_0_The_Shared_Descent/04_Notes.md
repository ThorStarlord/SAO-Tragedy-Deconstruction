# Route 0 Notes

- Use this file for brainstorming, development notes, and route-specific ideas.

### Scene 1: The Crisis
*   **Event:** Yui's data becomes corrupted, causing her to flicker in and out of existence, her voice distorted.
*   **Asuna's Reaction:** Panicked and emotional, she sees her daughter in distress.
*   **Kirito's Reaction:** Immediately shifts into "beater" mode. He analyzes the data streams, discusses error codes, and focuses on the technical problem. He dismisses Asuna's emotional pleas as unhelpful distractions.
*   **Key Dialogue Snippet:** Asuna: "Kirito, she's in pain!" Kirito: "It's corrupted data, Asuna. We need to find the source of the bug."

### Scene 2: The Quest
*   **Event:** The party discovers the "Yui Restoration Quest," a high-level, non-canon quest designed to restore unique AI data.
*   **Requirement:** The quest requires a specific, rare class: the Incubus Warlock, capable of manipulating "emotional data."
*   **Introduction of the Antagonist:** They find the only available Incubus Warlock, a solo player with a neutral reputation. He's polite, a bit aloof, and agrees to join them for a share of the reward.

### Scene 3: The First Sign of Trouble
*   **Event:** The party must navigate a dangerous, trap-filled dungeon to reach the quest's next stage.
*   **Kirito's Choice:** Kirito chooses a shortcut through a high-risk area, calculating that the time saved outweighs the danger. He announces the plan without discussion.
*   **Friction:** The route is stressful. Asuna nearly falls into a pitfall trap. Kirito saves her but is annoyed, telling her to "keep up."
*   **Antagonist's Action:** The Warlock, seeing Asuna is shaken, offers her a calming potion and a quiet, reassuring word. "He is focused on the goal. Do not mistake his intensity for a lack of care." It's a small, kind gesture. Asuna is grateful.

### Scene 4: The Branching Point
*   **Event:** The party reaches a "Class Sanctum" where the Warlock must choose his advanced class path. The choice is presented as permanent.
*   **The Two Paths:**
    *   **Path 1 (Tank/Support):** "Path of the Protector." Focuses on defense, support, and absorbing damage for allies.
    *   **Path 2 (DPS):** "Path of the Passionate." Focuses on high-risk, high-reward damage that scales with emotional intensity.
*   **Kirito's Decision:** Without consulting anyone, Kirito analyzes the party's composition. They have enough DPS; they lack a dedicated tank. He instructs the Warlock to take the "Protector" path. He explains it in purely mechanical terms: "Your aggro-draw abilities will synergize perfectly with my dual-wielding DPS."
*   **Asuna's Reaction:** She's silent, accustomed to Kirito making these calls.
*   **Antagonist's Reaction:** He simply nods. "As the party leader decides."
*   **End of Act One:** The Warlock's choice is locked in. A subtle, almost unnoticed narrative flag appears: "The Path of Tragedy has been chosen." or "The Path of Satire has been chosen." The players don't see this, but it signals the route lock to the audience.
Here’s an expanded outline for Act One (“The Flawed Foundation Route”) with foreshadowing moments and a suggested scene list:

## Expanded Scene List & Foreshadowing

### Scene 1: The Crisis
- **Event:** Yui’s data corruption.
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - Yui’s glitchy dialogue includes cryptic warnings (“Not all bonds are safe…”).
  - Asuna’s emotional pleas are ignored by Kirito, hinting at future emotional neglect.
  - The system briefly flashes a strange error code referencing “emotional resonance” (real clue for Warlock’s importance).

### Scene 2: The Quest
- **Event:** Discovery of the “Yui Restoration Quest.”
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - The quest’s description mentions “the price of desire” (real clue for tragic/erotic routes).
  - Kirito dismisses the quest’s “emotional” requirements as “flavor text” (false clue—he’s wrong).
  - The Warlock’s player bio is oddly blank, and his avatar’s eyes flicker with two different colors (hinting at duality, false clue for antagonist).

### Scene 3: The First Sign of Trouble
- **Event:** Dungeon navigation, party friction.
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - The Warlock’s calming potion for Asuna is described as “sweet, with a bitter aftertaste” (metaphor for future relationships).
  - Asuna’s status screen flickers, briefly showing a new stat: “Emotional Vulnerability” (real clue for her arc).
  - Kirito’s shortcut is riskier than he admits, and the system logs a “party trust” variable (false clue—players don’t see this).

### Scene 4: The Interlude (New)
- **Event:** Campfire scene before the Class Sanctum.
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - The Warlock asks Asuna about her “greatest fear in this world,” and she hesitates (real clue for tragedy).
  - Kirito and Asuna’s conversation is awkward, with Asuna glancing at the Warlock (hint at future emotional drift).
  - The Warlock is seen reading a mysterious in-game book titled “The Price of Power” (false clue—could be a red herring).

### Scene 5: The Branching Point
- **Event:** Arrival at the Class Sanctum, class path choice.
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - The system message: “Warning: This choice will shape the fate of all bonds.”
  - The Warlock hesitates, glancing at both Kirito and Asuna before confirming his path.
  - Asuna’s status screen again flickers, this time showing “Desire” and “Guilt” stats (real clue for erotic/tragedy routes).

### Scene 6: The Lock
- **Event:** The choice is made, route is locked.
- **Foreshadowing:**
  - A subtle, hidden system flag: “The Path of Tragedy/Satire has been chosen.”
  - The Warlock’s eyes briefly glow, and the background music shifts to a minor key.
  - Asuna feels a chill, as if something irreversible has happened.

---

## Notes on Foreshadowing
- **Real clues**: Emotional stats, system warnings, Yui’s dialogue, Asuna’s reactions.
- **False clues**: Kirito’s dismissals, Warlock’s mysterious book, party trust variable.
- **Balance**: Each scene should have at least one real and one false clue, keeping the audience guessing and supporting the parody/satire tone.

Here are recommendations for your initial branching route, based on your project’s structure and goals:

---

### 1. What should this route be called?
- **Suggested Name:** “Prologue Route: The Flawed Foundation” or simply “The Flawed Foundation Route”
- This name matches your act title and signals to the reader/player that this is the shared starting point before the story branches.

---

### 2. What should be the size of the route (number of scenes)?
- **Recommended Size:** 4–6 scenes
  - 4 scenes is a minimum for establishing the world, characters, and the inciting incident.
  - 6 scenes allows for more character moments, foreshadowing, and a natural escalation to the branching point.
- Your current outline (in the file) already has 4 strong scenes. You could add 1–2 more for deeper character introduction or early tension if desired.

---

### 3. How much foreshadowing (clues and false clues) should this route have?
- **Foreshadowing:** Moderate, with a mix of real and misleading clues.
  - Each major route (tragedy, satire, erotic, etc.) should have at least one subtle hint in dialogue, character behavior, or game mechanics.
  - Include 1–2 “red herrings” (false clues) to keep the audience guessing and to support the parody/satire tone.
  - Example: The Warlock’s ambiguous comments, Asuna’s subtle reactions, or odd system messages.

---

### 4. How should this route start?
- **Best Approach:** Start with action (Yui’s data corruption crisis), but weave in character introductions and context as the crisis unfolds.
  - This hooks the audience immediately and allows you to introduce both canon and non-canon characters organically.
  - Use the crisis to show each character’s personality and role (e.g., Kirito’s logic, Asuna’s emotion, Janus’s introduction as the needed Warlock).
  - Parody elements can be layered in through dialogue, reactions, and the absurdity of the situation.

---

### Summary of Approach
- **Route Name:** “The Flawed Foundation Route” (or similar)
- **Scenes:** 4–6, as in your current outline, with room for expansion
- **Foreshadowing:** 1–2 real clues per major route, 1–2 false clues
- **Start:** With the Yui crisis, introducing characters and parody context through action and interaction
