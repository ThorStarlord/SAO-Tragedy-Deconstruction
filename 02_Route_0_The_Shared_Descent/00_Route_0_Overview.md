This is a masterfully detailed and well-thought-out plan. You have not only defined the routes but also created a brilliant, thematically resonant gameplay mechanic to branch them. The "class advancement" choice is the perfect vehicle for Kirito's tragic flaw.

Now, let's construct the three-act "Route 0" that logically and emotionally leads up to this critical choice, using all the excellent character details you've provided, while saving your major plot devices (Yui Ritual, CMRS, False Confession, Health Deterioration) for the later routes.

---

### **Route 0: The Shared Descent (A Tragedy of Misguided Kindness)**

**Central Theme:** How a series of small, well-intentioned acts of kindness can, through emotional neglect and misunderstanding, weave a perfect trap.

---

### **Act One: The Invitation**

*   **Inciting Incident (The Real World):** The story starts at school. We are introduced to **Makoto (Janus)**, a tall, handsome, but painfully shy and introverted classmate. Asuna, who shares a similar background of strict parenting, sees a kindred spirit in his loneliness and feels a pang of empathy. She suggests to Kirito that they should invite him to play FOG Online to help him break out of his shell.
*   **Kirito's Flaw (The First "Optimization"):** Kirito agrees, not just out of kindness, but because he sees potential. "A new player we can mold? We can get him leveled up fast and he could be a great asset for our party. Good idea, Asuna." He immediately frames the act of friendship as a long-term party optimization strategy.
*   **The "Gift" of the Class:** They bring Makoto into FOG. He creates his avatar, "Janus." During the tutorial or an initial quest, he is presented with a "Box of Latent Potential" that will grant him a unique rare class. Kirito, using his vast game knowledge, advises him to choose a specific ritual to open it, calculating that it has the highest probability of yielding a powerful class. The ritual works, and Janus is granted the "Incubus Warlock" class.
*   **The Initial Disappointment:** The class, at its base level, is very weak. Its stats are poor, and its "Mind Hex" and "Debuff" skills seem useless in early-game PvE. Kirito is disappointed. "Huh, a support debuffer. Not what I was hoping for, but we'll make it work." He completely overlooks the class's true, hidden potential in psychological manipulation.
*   **End of Act One:** The trio is formed. Kirito has a new "project" to optimize. Asuna has a new person to care for. And Janus, grateful and timid, has a place where he finally feels accepted. The stage is set with a foundation of good intentions.

---

### **Act Two: The Unseen Bond**

This act focuses on establishing the emotional rift between Kirito and Asuna, and the unintentional bonding between Asuna and Janus.

*   **The Training Montage (Kirito's Way):** Kirito takes charge of power-leveling Janus. These scenes are efficient, fast-paced, and focused entirely on mechanics. Kirito is a great teacher, but a terrible emotional mentor. He constantly tells Janus *what* to do, but never asks him *how he feels*. Asuna is present, but often feels like a third wheel in Kirito's hyper-efficient training sessions.
*   **The Quiet Conversations (Asuna's Way):** After the intense training sessions, Kirito logs off to analyze data or plan the next day. Asuna, seeing that Janus is overwhelmed, stays behind to talk to him. These are the scenes where their bond forms. They talk about their strict parents, their real-world anxieties, their shared feeling of not quite fitting in. Janus, for the first time, has someone who is listening to him. Asuna, for her part, is fulfilling her "caretaker" role and finding an emotional connection that is missing from Kirito's "gamer" focus.
*   **The First "Success":** They face a mid-level boss that is immune to physical damage but vulnerable to debuffs. Kirito's brute force is useless. He gets frustrated. Asuna, using the understanding she's built with Janus, helps him use his "Mind Hex" ability in a creative way to defeat the boss.
*   **The Misinterpretation (The Climax of Act Two):** They win. Kirito is ecstatic. "See! I knew this class had potential! My strategy of bringing him along paid off. We just need to find the right way to optimize his skills." He sees the victory as a confirmation of his **tactical genius.** He completely fails to see that the victory was only possible because of the **emotional bond** Asuna had built with Janus. Asuna and Janus share a look. She feels a mix of pride and a strange, secret intimacy. He feels a surge of confidence. The rift between Kirito's perception and their reality is now a chasm.

---

### **Act Three: The Path Forward**

This act is about solidifying the roles and leading directly to the fatal choice.

*   **A New Dynamic:** The party continues, but the dynamic has shifted. Asuna and Janus now work together with an unspoken synergy that Kirito doesn't understand but encourages for its "efficiency." He feels like a successful team manager.
*   **The Catalyst for Advancement:** They complete a major quest, and the system announces that Janus has now reached the level required for his **Class Advancement.**
*   **The Final Scene (The Branching Point):** The three of them stand before the Class Sanctum. A massive skill tree appears, showing the different potential paths. Kirito, in his element, steps forward with confidence.
    *   **Kirito:** "Alright, Janus, this is a big moment. The right choice here will define your role in the party for a long time. I've already run the numbers. Asuna, you should see this..."
    *   He then proceeds to lay out the different paths (Pledge of the Confidante, Siren's Embrace, Bond of Devotion, etc.), explaining their tactical pros and cons in pure, cold, "gamer" logic. He is completely blind to the thematic and emotional horror of what he is describing.
    *   **The Choice:** The final decision is presented to the player (as Kirito). "Based on your analysis, which path is the most optimal for the party's future success?"

The scene ends as the player makes their choice, locking in the route for the rest of the game. Kirito, in his ultimate act of "helpful" optimization, has just personally selected the weapon of his own destruction, and he believes it is his greatest triumph as a leader.

## Foreshadowing, Clues, and Narrative Flags

For a detailed list of real clues, false clues, and narrative flags embedded throughout Route 0, see the dedicated file: `05_Foreshadowing_and_Clues.md`. That file is the primary reference for all intentional foreshadowing, red herrings, and setup/payoff elements. Writers and designers should consult it to ensure consistency and to track which narrative seeds are planted in each act or scene.
