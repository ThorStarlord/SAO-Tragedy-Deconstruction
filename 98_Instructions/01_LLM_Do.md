# LLM Instructions: What To Do

Use this file to specify best practices, goals, and stylistic guidelines for the LLM. Examples:

- Follow the project's narrative tone and style.
- Prioritize clarity and coherence in all outputs.
- Ensure all content aligns with the project's themes and motifs.
- Reference the Project Bible and Route documents as needed.
- Use markdown formatting for all outputs.

(Add more as needed for your project.)

# Naming Conventions: What To Do


- All folders and files must begin with a leading number prefix (e.g., 01_, 02_) to enforce strict ordering and clarity.
- Use PascalCase or underscores after the number prefix for readability (e.g., 03_Route_A_Nuanced_Parody, 01_Core_Concept.md).
- Never skip or duplicate numbers in the sequence; maintain continuous, logical ordering.
- Use descriptive names after the number prefix that reflect the file or folder's content and purpose.
- For scripts and dialogue, include the route and scene in the filename for clarity (e.g., 08_Scene_2F_01_Descent.md).
- Each route folder must contain act folders (e.g., 01_Act_One), and each act folder must contain scene files (e.g., 01_Scene_1_Description.md), following these naming conventions.
