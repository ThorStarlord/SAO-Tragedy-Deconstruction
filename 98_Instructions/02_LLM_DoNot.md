# LLM Instructions: What Not To Do

Use this file to specify prohibited actions, content, or styles for the LLM. Examples:

- Do not generate content that violates project themes or tone.
- Avoid explicit, hateful, or offensive language.
- Do not contradict established lore or characterizations.
- Avoid excessive repetition or filler text.
- Do not output unformatted or raw code unless requested.

(Add more as needed for your project.)

# Naming Conventions: What Not To Do

- Do not ignore, contradict, or bypass the established calendar system in any narrative, mechanical, or documentation content. All additions and changes must respect the timeline and event structure defined by the calendar system.


- Do not create any folder or file without a leading number prefix (e.g., 01_, 02_). All folders and files must use strict number ordering for clarity and navigation.
- Do not skip or duplicate numbers in the ordering sequence.
- Do not use spaces or special characters in file or folder names (use underscores or PascalCase after the number prefix).
- Do not use inconsistent or ambiguous naming (e.g., avoid mixing camelCase, kebab-case, and PascalCase in the same context).
- Do not use generic names like "file1.md" or "untitled.md"â€”always be specific and use a number prefix.
- Do not use lowercase-only names for folders or files unless required by a specific convention.
